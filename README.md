# Final Project for Commercial English, UPSO.

Participants:
* Fernandez, Franco Emanuel
* Gomez Pe√±a, Lucas Adrian
* Grosso, M Alejandro
* Huck, Gabriel
* Lopez, Julieta Anahi
* Wagner Canbrera, Idana Noely

## Introduction
In this project, we decided to create a real website as we considered it a great opportunity to put into practice the knowledge acquired in other subjects, as well as a significant challenge to complete entirely in English.
Below, you will find two links. The first one leads to the visible and functional website, while the second one is a project repository where you can see all the code developed for it. To maintain linguistic consistency, all parameters, class names, etc., were also written in English.
